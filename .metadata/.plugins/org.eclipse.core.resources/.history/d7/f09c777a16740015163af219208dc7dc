/**
 * Used for a class that can listen for a specific 
 * module type to be added to the module tree. One should 
 * make a module that implements this class and place it 
 * inside of the module system. It is highly advised that
 * the user makes a fixed number of module listeners -- listeners
 * are supposed to provide a basic communication system in the framework
 * where a single module can process a dynamic number of modules as
 * they are created.
 * 
 * When we add a module to the tree that extends ModuleListener, 
 * we add the class to the list of active listeners.
 * 
 * Note: Every ModuleListener MUST have a @ListenOn annotation.
 * 
 * We use the ModuleListener<T>
