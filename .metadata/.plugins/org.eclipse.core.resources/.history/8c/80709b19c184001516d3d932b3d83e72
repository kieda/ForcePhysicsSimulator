'''
Represents a series of parallel boundaries such that each boundary
is parallel to one another. 

Note that this is mostly useful in the 3d case, which all faces cannot be 
described by triangles in 3d.

    A face represents a series of boundaries that

    When the user specifies a series of triangles that
    form a polygon in three-space, it's useful to treat it like a
    single object, so we don't emit an excessive number of boundary crossing
    events as a particle moves across the polygon's surface.
