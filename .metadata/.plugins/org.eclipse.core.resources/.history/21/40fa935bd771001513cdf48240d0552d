 * the user makes a fixed number of module listeners -- listeners
 * are supposed to provide a basic communication system in the framework
 * where a single module can process many other modules.
 * 
 * When we add a module to the tree that extends ModuleListener, 
 * we add the class to the list of active listeners.
